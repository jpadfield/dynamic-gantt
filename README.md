This is an interactive live gantt or timeline system which can automatically convert simple tab separated triples into gantt charts using the [mermaid library](https://mermaid-js.github.io/mermaid). 

## Instructions
Full details and instructions relating to how this system works is still being developed, however several examples are included in the interactive web site: [dynamic gantt](https://research.ng-london.org.uk/gantt/), with all of the related code presented here in [GitHub](https://github.com/jpadfield/dynamic-gantt).
